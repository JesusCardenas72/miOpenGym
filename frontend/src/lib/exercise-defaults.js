// whether it is bodyweight, whether reps are counted per side, the belt load, the rep ceiling,
// the intensifier, and how it progresses — is a property of the exercise: the first time you
// configure it anywhere, that is what it means, and every later routine should start there.
// How *much* of it a routine asks for — sets, and the working weight on loaded work — is the
// routine's business, and two routines are expected to disagree about it.
//
// Every function here takes a config whose `bodyweight` is already RESOLVED to a boolean by
// the caller (a saved config only writes the flag when it differs from the dataset, so
// `cfg.bodyweight` on its own cannot be trusted). See isBw in history.js.
