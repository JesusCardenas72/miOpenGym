// The microcycle as a counted block of sessions, not a stretch of calendar.
//
// A training strategy defines how many sessions close one microcycle — full body 3,
// upper/lower 4 (and any similar four-day split, whatever it mixes), push/pull/legs 6.
// None of those map onto a week: six sessions with rest days interleaved routinely span
// nine or ten days, so anything counted per week cuts a microcycle in half.
//
// So a microcycle is counted in sessions from an explicit start (`program.cycleStart`).
// The end needs no marking: session `len` closes the block and session `len + 1` opens the
// next one. Rest days are free — train Tuesday or train Thursday, either way the session
// that happens is the next step of the sequence. That is why the routine to propose comes
// from a *positional* pointer (`nextStepOf`) and not from projecting the sequence onto
// dates: a sequence like Push A, Pull A, Legs, Push B, Pull B, Legs repeats a routine, and
// only the position tells the two Legs days apart.
//
// See lib/program.js for the calendar projection (which days you intend to train) and
// lib/volume.js for what the block's volume adds up to.
