/**
 * Whether completing a set should start a rest timer.

 * A rest belongs after every completed set — the last set of an exercise included, because
 * another exercise follows it and you rest before that one too. The only set with nothing
 * left to time is the last set of the last exercise, where the session is over.
 *
 * Ordinary exercises used to "finish quietly" instead: an exercise started no rest on its
 * closing set, so a two-set exercise timed one rest instead of two (issue #3) and a rest
 * never carried across the gap into the next exercise. Supersets already did it this way.

/**
 * Whether re-checking an already-completed set should start a rest.
 *
 * The high-water rule deliberately swallows a re-check so that unchecking and re-checking
 * finished work does not replay navigation or reopen sheets. But a re-check is still you
 * telling the app a set is done, and that is the other half of issue #3 — "after the first
 * set, sometimes a break doesn't appear". That is what it looks like when you uncheck a set
 * to correct the reps after its rest has already run out: nothing times the rest you are
 * actually about to take.
 *
 * So: fill a gap, never disturb a rest that is already counting down. A timer that is running
 * belongs to the set you finished most recently, which is a better answer than restarting it.
 *
 * One exception. When the re-check finishes the exercise, a separate rest-between-exercises time
 * exists (`exRestDiffers`) and the rest still counting is a between-sets one, that rest is the
 * wrong break: the two must not stack, so it is replaced by the between-exercises rest rather
 * than left to run out first. With no separate time the rest counting is already the right one.

 * of curls do not want the same break. One that carries none inherits `defaultRestSec`, the
 * global rest timer, which is what every routine did before the field existed.
 *
 * `unit` is the superset group the set belongs to, as entry indices — a plain exercise is a
 * group of one. A group rests once, after the round, so it takes the LONGEST rest any of its
 * members asked for: the shortest would send you back to the bar before the member that needs
 * the most recovery is ready.
 *
 * `defaultRestSec` of 0 is the rest timer turned off (v1.2.11). That silences the members that
 * have no rest of their own, but an exercise that explicitly asks for one still gets it — the
 * setting is a default, and this field overrides the default.
