// block whose length is not seven days: two Push/Pull/Legs rounds are six sessions, and once
// rest days are interleaved the block routinely spans nine, ten, eleven calendar days and
// then drifts against the week. A program is that block spelled out instead — an ordered
// sequence of steps, each a routine or a rest day — anchored to a start date and repeated
// from there, so "Legs, rest, Push, Pull, rest, …" projects onto real dates however long it
// takes to come back around. See the periodizacion-microciclo note.
//
// The program is the calendar layout only; the volume window (how many recent sessions make
// one microcycle for the effective-set panel) stays S.microcycleSessions — see lib/volume.js.
