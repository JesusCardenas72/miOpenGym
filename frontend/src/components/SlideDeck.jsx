/**
 * Two screens that slide past each other: the one arriving comes in from a border and pushes
 * the one it replaces out the opposite side.
 *
 * The deck is only the *presentation* — it never decides what the gesture meant. Callers own
 * the pointer handling (they each have their own rules about what a horizontal drag competes
 * with) and drive the deck with four numbers: what is showing, what is being dragged into
 * view, which side that neighbour sits on, and how far the finger has travelled. Change
 * `current` and the deck animates the rest of the way from wherever the finger left off, so a
 * committed swipe is one continuous movement rather than a drag followed by a separate
 * animation. Tapping a tab, with no drag at all, lands in the same path with `from` at the
 * screen edge — one code path, one look.
 *
 * The neighbour is rendered for real, not faked, which is what makes it a push instead of a
 * reveal; callers only hand one over once the drag has committed to the horizontal axis, so
 * the cost of mounting it is paid on genuine intent and at most once per gesture.
