/**
 * Swipe sideways to walk along the tab bar — Home, Plan, Stats, Exercises — with the screen
 * you are going to arriving from the border and pushing the one you are leaving out.
 *
 * Any pointer drives it — a finger, a pen, or a mouse held down and dragged. Only the primary
 * button, and only past the distance in lib/swipe.js that tells a drag from a click, so an
 * ordinary press still lands on whatever it was aimed at. Everything else about *what* a drag
 * means is in lib/swipe.js and lib/screen-nav.js; this component is the wiring between the two
 * and the deck that draws the result.
